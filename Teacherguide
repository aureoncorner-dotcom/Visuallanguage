# CTA-PX Teacher Guide (v1)

CTA-PX is a visual communication system for helping students express:
- confusion  
- overwhelm  
- need for clarity  
- need for space  
- readiness  
- and “we’re ok again”

It uses simple shapes instead of emotional language.

## HOW TO USE CTA-PX IN CLASS

### 1. Teach the symbols (1–2 minutes)
Use the flashcards or poster.
Kids memorize them instantly.

### 2. Use check-ins
At the start of class:
- Students hold up a symbol.
Examples:
- O→R→S = “I’m good”
- O⟂ = “I’m confused”
- O↓ = “I need a pause”

### 3. Use during conflict or misunderstanding
If two students are misaligned:
Teacher points to:
```
O → R ⟂ S
```
= “We’re mixed up.”

Then moves to:
```
O ↓
```
= “Pause.”

Then:
```
O ↑
```
= “Try again.”

### 4. Use for emotional regulation
A student who cannot verbalize “I need space” can show:
```
O ←
```

### 5. Use for transitions
When a student is ready to rejoin:
```
→ O
```

### 6. Use scripts (provided in CTA-PX Scripts file)
